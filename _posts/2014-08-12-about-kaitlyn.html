<p>Hi! I'm Kaitlyn. I'm a coach for neurodivergent folks who are ready to live a more seamless life. I am, and have always been, a cheerleader, an emotional support friend (an ESF if you will) and someone who wants to make a tangible impact in her community.

I was born and raised on the island of Hawaiâ€™i, but I'm currently based out of Brooklyn, NY. I live in the most adorable co-op imaginable and I'm that person who asks to pet every dog that walks by on the street. 

I also am a storyteller and project manager specializing in sustainability in wellness. I love to complicate recipes and make things with my hands. I work with my best friend on an online food mag, <a title="Closed Loop Cooking" href="https://closedloopcooking.com/" display : inline;>Closed Loop Cooking </a>, that aims to make a low-impact lifestyle accessible to any one who eats.
