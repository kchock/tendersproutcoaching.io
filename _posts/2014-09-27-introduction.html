<p>Hello and welcome! My name is Kaitlyn and I'm so happy you're here. As we both know, living with ADHD in a world not built for our squiggly brains can be really tough. But that's where I come in. If you're struggling with executive functioning, self-regulation, self-esteem or anything else ADHD related, let me help. I work with clients to help them live happier, more efficient, fulfilling lives. 
<br>
  <br>
As a kid, I was always told I was too loud, too talkative, too energetic. I tried to stuff that all down to fit the mold that society built for us but I simply could not. And as a result, I spent lots of time upset at myself, procrastinating, panicking and a lot of fun verbs that I'm sure a lot of you can relate to. So, as someone who was always told she was "too much," my mission is to help my clients realize how incredible and expansive they are, to see neurodivergence as a gift and to create systems that work for them.
<br>
  <br>
If you're feeling stuck and don't know where to turn, you don't have to face this alone. I think each of us needs a support system to truly flourish and I want to be that person for you. Through our work together we can help you build the life you want and deserve.  Reach out to me when you're ready for a complimentary consultation.   </p>
